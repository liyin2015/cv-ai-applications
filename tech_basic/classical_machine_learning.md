# Classicial Machine Learning

Pythonâ€™s scikit-learn library is that is has a 4-step modeling pattern that makes it easy to code a machine learning classifier. While this tutorial uses a classifier called Logistic Regression, the coding process in this tutorial applies to other classifiers in sklearn (Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbors etc)
