# Computer Vision Overview

We can use *task learning* and *representation learning* to categorize: the first aims at solving a specific task with curated dataset(labeled and supervised often) and is often considered as downstream tasks and the later aims at obtaining visual representations often in the form of embeddings as an upstream pre-training.
